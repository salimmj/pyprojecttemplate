# Python Development Environment with uv and Ruff

This repository provides a modern Python development environment using VSCode's Dev Container feature, with uv for package management and Ruff for code formatting/linting.

## Features

### Core Components
- üê≥ Containerized development environment using VSCode Dev Containers
- üöÄ Fast package management with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- ‚ú® Code formatting and linting with [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)
- üîç Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- üîÑ GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- üêç Python 3.12 by default

### Development Environment

The development container is configured to provide a consistent and efficient Python development experience:

- **Fast Package Management**: Uses `uv` instead of pip for significantly faster dependency management
- **Modern Code Quality Tools**: Integrated Ruff for both formatting and linting
- **Git Integration**: Automatic mounting of local Git and SSH configurations
- **Pre-configured VSCode**: Essential extensions and settings for Python development
- **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions workflows for testing, linting, and Docker builds

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

3. Open in VSCode
4. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container"
5. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```
6. Enter your project name when prompted

### Package Management

Use uv to manage Python packages. Since the project is already initialized, then from the root of the project run:

```bash
uv sync
```

To run python code, use the following command:

```bash
uv run python <path_to_script>
```

To run tests, use the following command:
